The DB Migration module is a standalone module that is used to manage the database schema and data.
It depends on the `DB` module.

=== Configuration

The configuration of the DB Migration module is done in the `application.yml` file, in a `db-migration` section.
Parameters are:

- `log-after`: (duration) the time after which the migration log will be printed.
It must be declared in the ISO-8601 format.
Default is `PT5s` (five seconds).
See link:https://github.com/rolang/dumbo[Dumbo] for more information.
- `validate-on-migrate`: (boolean) whether to validate the schema after migration.

=== Usage

In order to use the DB Migration module, you need to add it as a dependency to your project.

The migrations are written in SQL and are located in the `src/main/resources/db/migration` directory of your project.

The migration files must be named in the following format: `V\{version}__{description}.sql`, where:

- `\{version}` is the version of the migration, and
- `{description}` is a description of the migration.

The migration files are executed in the order of their version.

To execute the migrations, you can use the `migrate` method of the `DBMigration[F]` class.
