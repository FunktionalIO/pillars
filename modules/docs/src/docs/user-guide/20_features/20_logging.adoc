Logging is a very important part of any application.
It allows you to see what is happening in your application and to debug it.
Pillars uses the link:https://github.com/outr/scribe[scribe] library for logging.

== Configuration

The logging configuration is described in the xref:10_configuration.adoc#logging-configuration[Configuration] section.

== Logging in your code

To log something in your code, you can use the `logger` defined in the `pillars` package.

[source,scala]
----
def run(using Pillars[IO]): IO[Unit] =
    for
        _ <- logger.info(s"ðŸ“š Welcome to ${config.name}!")
        _ <- logger.debug(s"ðŸ“š The configuration is: $config")
    yield ()
----

As the logger is configured before the application starts, you can use it in any part of your code with the classic scribe usage.

[source,scala]
----
import scribe.warn
import scribe.cats.io.info

def foo: IO[Unit] = info("Hello from foo!")

def bar: Unit = warn("Hello from bar!")
----
